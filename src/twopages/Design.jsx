            <h2 className='text-[14px] sm:text-[16px] font-[500] py-2'>Balance & Alignment</h2>
            <p>You should always keep in mind that each element you place on a website
             has a weight. Color, size, or texture can all contribute to weight. You
              wouldn't put all your furniture in one corner of a room, and the same 
              rule applies to composition: don't jam all your heavy pieces into one spot
              . Your audience will feel as if their eye is slipping off the page if there
               is an imbalance. type st.</p>
               <p>By placing equally weighted components on either side of a center line,
                 symmetrical design achieves balance.</p>
               <p>Asymmetrical design, on the other hand, uses opposing weights to produce 
                an uneven composition that nonetheless maintains equilibrium 
                (for example, by contrasting one huge element with multiple smaller parts) <a href='https://99designs.com/blog/tips/principles-of-design/'>Read more..</a>.</p>

        <h2 className='text-[14px] sm:text-[16px] font-[500] py-2 '>Contrast</h2>
          <p>When someone says a design "pops," they're referring to contrast.
             It stands out from the page and stays in your mind. Contrast makes the
             differences and spaces between your design's pieces stand out.</p>
             <p>Understanding contrast is crucial if you want to work with type 
              since it shows that your type's weight and size are balanced.

              how will your readers determine what is most important?</p>

        <h2 className='text-[14px] sm:text-[16px] font-[500] py-2 '>Repetition</h2>
          <p>Repeated elements reinforce and unify a design, it is commonly believed.
             Your band's poster can seem incorrect if it has just one line of blue italic
              sans-serif type. Three things in blue italic sans-serif gives you a motif
             and puts you back in charge of your design if they are all in that style.</p>

        <h2 className='text-[14px] sm:text-[16px] font-[500] py-2'>Proportional</h2>
          <p>The visual weight and size of components in a composition, as well as their
             relationship to one another, is known as proportion.</p>
             <p>Only when all of your design's components are accurately scaled and
               properly positioned can proportion be attained. When
               alignment, balance, and contrast are mastered, proportion should naturally follow.</p>

        <h2 className='text-[14px] sm:text-[16px] font-[500] py-2 '>Movement</h2>
          <p>Controlling the composition's elements will help you effectively convey your message
             to your audience and guide the viewer's eye from one to the next.</p>
             <p>Movement creates the story or the narrative of your work: a band is playing, it’s at this location, it’s at this time, here’s how you get tickets. The
               elements above—especially balance, alignment, and contrast—will
               work towards that goal, but without proper movement, your design will be DOA.</p>

        <h2 className='text-[16px] font-[500] py-2 '>White Space</h2>
          <p>The vacant area on the page surrounding the components of your composition is known as white space.</p>
          <p>White space establishes hierarchy and order. Having a lot of white space around anything signals
             importance and luxury to our brains. It is indicating to our eyes that objects in one area are organized differently from objects in another.</p>

          <p>A design doesn’t have to strictly follow these rules to be “good.” Some absolutely mind-blowing designs ignore one or more of the principles of
             design in order to create an eye-catching and effective work.</p>

             <p>The movement and alignment rules are both obviously broken by the design. But! Your eye is quickly drawn to the book's title and author due to the confident use of a bright, contrasting color palette and a repeated structure by the designer.
